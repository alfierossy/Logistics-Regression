# Logistics-Regression
A statistical method
Logistic regression is a statistical method with significant business implications, primarily used for predicting categorical outcomes, such as customer behaviors or binary decisions like "yes" or "no." By analyzing various input variables, it helps businesses make informed decisions based on probabilities and correlations. In marketing, logistic regression can aid in identifying factors influencing customer churn or purchase likelihood. In risk management, it can assess the likelihood of specific events occurring, allowing businesses to allocate resources effectively and minimize potential losses. Logistic regression plays a pivotal role in data-driven decision-making, optimizing strategies, and enhancing operational efficiency across various business domains.
